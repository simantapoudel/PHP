PSR 12
(PHP Standard Recommendations)

Regarding methods and functions:
    - snakeCase
    - there must not be a space after opening parentheses and 
      before closing parentheses.
    - opening brace and closing brace should be on it's own line. 
    - if there are many arguments, it is split across multiple lines
      and each line should have only one argument
    - closing parentheses and opening brace must be on same line with 
      space between them in case of split argument list.

Regarding control structures:
    - whitespace between the clauses,
        For example: if (2 < 3) {
            echo "2 is less than 3";
        }

Abstract, final and static

abstract and final before access modifier or visibility
static after modifier or visibility
